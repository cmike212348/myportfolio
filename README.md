This is the Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio assignment.
I am having quite a bit of trouble with this assignment.
This is a basic portfolio website. Displaying previous work as well as contact information
When I have the time, I will revisit this project to fix errors and improve aesthetics.
